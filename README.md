Smart Home Automation System:

The Smart Home Automation System is an integrated solution designed to automate household tasks using various sensors and actuators, incorporating light control, gas leak detection, motion detection, and door control via a servo motor, all managed by an Arduino board. This project features ambient light control using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), gas leak detection with an MQ-2 gas sensor, motion detection via a PIR sensor to control devices and LEDs, automatic door control based on ultrasonic distance measurement, and sound alerts with a piezo buzzer in case of gas detection. The hardware requirements include an Arduino Uno (or compatible board), a servo motor, an LDR, an MQ-2 gas sensor, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a PIR motion sensor, a piezo buzzer, red and green LEDs, resistors (220Ω and 10kΩ), a breadboard, and jumper wires. The software requirements include the Arduino IDE and the Servo Library. To install, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, open the smart_home_system.ino file in the Arduino IDE, and connect your Arduino board. After wiring the components according to the documentation, upload the code and open the Serial Monitor to view sensor readings and system status. The code integrates functionalities for reading sensor values, controlling a relay for light based on LDR readings, activating a piezo buzzer for gas leak alerts, and operating a servo motor for door control based on distance measurements.
